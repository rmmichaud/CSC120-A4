Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I was pretty confused by how Encapsulation works and what attributes and methods should be considered public or private. It's a lot different than any programming I had done previously and is definitely going to take a lot of getting used to. I think it's really helpful in terms of organization and being thoughtful about what attributes and methods I'm referencing. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment was definitely longer and harder than the previous ones. I would definitely recommend getting started early and talking to other students in the class to help.
